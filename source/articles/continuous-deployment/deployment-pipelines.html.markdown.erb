On Codeship, you are able to define **deployment pipelines**. A deployment pipeline is bound to a branch. Everytime a build runs for this branch, it kicks off your deployment pipeline.

Additionally, you can add multiple deployments within one deployment pipeline. This way, you can deploy for example to a staging environment first and only if that succeeds, to the production environment. This process is fully automated on Codeship and in case of errors you'll immediatelly get notified.

## [Set up a deployment pipeline](#setup-branch){:name="setup-branch"}
Go to your the ***Deployment*** page of your project settings to set up your deployment.

Add a branch you want to deploy and save it.

Choose your hosting provider or deployment method.

Fill in the deployment configuration and click the green checkmark on the top right of your deployment to save it."
![Save Deployment](deployment/save_deployment.png)

On the next push to this branch (in this case 'master') and if all tests pass the deployment will be triggered.

Now you can add additional deployments or configure another deployment pipeline.

## [Add additional deployment methods](#additional-deployments){:name="additional-deployments"}

You can add multiple deployments to one deployment pipeline. They will run sequentially and can be ordered by dragging the deployment symbol.

## [Deploy another branch](#deploy-another-branch){:name="deploy-another-branch"}
If you want to create a deployment pipeline for another branch, click on "Add a branch to deploy" and enter the branch name.

After saving the deployment pipeline you can add your deployment methods for that branch.

## [Edit Branch Settings](#edit-branch){:name="edit-branch"}
By clicking on "Edit Branch Settings" you can change the branch name or delete that branch.

## [Use Script Deployment for custom deployments / commands](#script-deployment){:name="script-deployment"}

You can use the <%= docs_link_to "Script Deployment", "/continuous-deployment/deploying-with-your-own-script/" %> to run your custom deployment commands or to execute other tasks right after or before a deployment.
