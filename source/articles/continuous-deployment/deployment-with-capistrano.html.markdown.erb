# Continuous Deployment with Capistrano

+ [Capistrano on Codeship](#capistrano-on-codeship)
+ [Capistrano with ScriptDeployment](#capistrano-with-script-deployment)

You can deploy any kind of Application with capistrano.
It's most commonly used in the Ruby on Rails community.
For some detailed information about Capistrano please checkout [capistranorb.com](http://capistranorb.com){:target="_blank"}.
Please include Capistrano in your project. We don't preinstall capistrano on our build servers.

## [Capistrano on Codeship](#capistrano-on-codeship){:name="capistrano-on-codeship"}

When your capistrano task is ready and working you just need to add the Capistrano Deployment on Codeship.
You just need to specify the task we should run for you. Most of the times this is `deploy`.
Checkout our <%= docs_link_to "Deployment Piplines", "/continuous-deployment/deployment-pipelines/" %> if you want to add multiple Capistrano Deployments.

## [Capistrano with ScriptDeployment](#capistrano-with-script-deployment){:name="capistrano-with-script-deployment"}

You don't need to use our Capistrano Integration. If you have a more complex Deployment Setup you can call capistrano directly.

~~~shell
bundle exec cap deploy
