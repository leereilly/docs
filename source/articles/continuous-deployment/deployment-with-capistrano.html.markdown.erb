When your capistrano task is ready and working you just need to add the Capistrano Deployment on Codeship.
You just need to specify the task we should run for you. Most of the times this is `deploy`.
Checkout our <%= docs_link_to "Deployment Piplines", "/continuous-deployment/deployment-pipelines/" %> if you want to add multiple Capistrano Deployments.
